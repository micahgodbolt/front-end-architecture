  * CSS/Sass Code standards and organization
  * Object Oriented approach (how do objects break down and get put together)
* Documentation
  * Onboarding Docs
  * Styleguide/Pattern Library
  * Architecture Diagrams (Code flow, tool chain)
* Testing
  * Regression/Unit testing
  * End to end testing
* Automation
  * Dependancy Management (NPM, Bundler, Bower)
  * Build Systems (Grunt/Gulp)
  * Continuous Integration (Travic CI, Jenkins)
