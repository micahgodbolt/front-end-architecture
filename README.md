## Working Definition
Front-end Architecture is a collection of tools and processes that aims to improve the quality of our front-end code while creating a more efficient and sustainable workflow.

A Front-end developer's audience is the website user, a Front-end Architect's audience is the developer themselves.

## Working Components of Front-end Architecture
* Code
  * HTML5/WAI-ARIA
  * CSS/Sass Code standards and organization
  * Object-Oriented approach (how do objects break down and get put together)
  * JS frameworks/organization/performance optimization techniques
  * Asset Delivery - Front-end Ops
* Documentation
  * Onboarding Docs
  * Styleguide/Pattern Library
  * Architecture Diagrams (code flow, tool chain)
* Testing
  * Performance Testing
  * Visual Regression
  * Unit Testing
  * End-to-End Testing
* Process
  * Git Workflow
  * Dependency Management (npm, Bundler, Bower)
  * Build Systems (Grunt/Gulp)
  * Deploy Process
  * Continuous Integration (Travis CI, Jenkins)
